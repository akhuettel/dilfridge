debugging of gpib driver:
* use nispy and labview-runtime from ni-gpib package instead of visa, makes debugging easier

Current TODO's:
* create a file that indicates if updateNIdrivers has to be run, and respect this in the nipal init script
(then our users just have to (re-)start this script after (re-)installing sth
* where does all this .nicore stuff come from, and do we need it?
* stricter permissions for /dev/nipalk and some files possible?
* bug report to NI:
	- tempfile
	- init_mm
	- typo in share_dir stuff
* do we need nispy, niorb and/or nirpc?
