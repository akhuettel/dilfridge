line 290 and follwing
the test checks for $headersDir/include/asm and files in there but this directory is not generated anymore 
during kernel build (not sure since when, maybe 2.6.31) -> please remove this check
As far as I can see at the moment, on 2.6.33 the best way to check is directly test the existence of 
$headersDir/.config

line 315 and following
this test does not work correctly anymore either, since version.h does not contain the cleartext version 
and utsrelease.h does not exist. 
My suggestion would be to grep $headersDir/.config for "# Linux kernel version: "
This line looks e.g. 
# Linux kernel version: 2.6.33-gentoo-r1



line 340:
please use "LANG=C $CC" instead of "$CC", else this breaks all non-english locales
