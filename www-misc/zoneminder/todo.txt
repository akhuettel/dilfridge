Warning: date() [function.date]: It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone 
settings. You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the 
date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those methods and 
you are still getting this warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone 
identifier. We selected 'Europe/Berlin' for 'CEST/2.0/DST' instead in
